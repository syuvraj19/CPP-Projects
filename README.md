## Projects

### ðŸ”¢ Calculator

**Objective**: Understand basic input/output operations and arithmetic in C++.

**Description**: This project implements a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.

**Files**:
- `calculator.cpp`

### ðŸŽ² Guess the Number

**Objective**: Understand loops and conditional statements in C++.

**Description**: This project is a number guessing game where the computer generates a random number, and the user has to guess it. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low until the user guesses the correct number.

**Files**:
- `guess_the_number.cpp`

### ðŸ“‚ File I/O

**Objective**: Learn how to read from and write to files in C++.

**Description**: This project reads a list of names from a file and writes them in reverse order to another file. It demonstrates basic file input/output operations and error handling.

**Files**:
- `file_io.cpp`
- `input.txt` (example input file)
- `output.txt` (generated output file)

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/syuvraj19/CPP-Projects.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change to the directory containing the project files:
    ```sh
    cd CPP-Projects
    ```

## How to Run

1. **Compile the Code**: Use a C++ compiler to compile the desired project file. For example, to compile the calculator project:
    ```sh
    g++ calculator.cpp -o calculator
    ```

2. **Run the Program**: Execute the compiled program. For example, to run the calculator project:
    ```sh
    ./calculator
    ```

### Example for File I/O Project

1. **Prepare the Input File**: Make sure the `input.txt` file is present in the same directory as `file_io.cpp`.

2. **Compile the Code**:
    ```sh
    g++ file_io.cpp -o file_io
    ```

3. **Run the Program**:
    ```sh
    ./file_io
    ```
